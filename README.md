# Reinforcement learning and optimal control experiments

This repo contains the implementation of some basic reinforcement learning algorithms as well as some optimal control problems. Below is the list of implementations.

- Iterative methods: [[source code](https://github.com/EmYassir/rl_optimal_control/blob/main/iterative_methods.ipynb)]
- Optimal control problems: [[source code](https://github.com/EmYassir/rl_optimal_control/blob/main/iterative_methods.ipynb)]
- The inventory problem: [[source code](https://github.com/EmYassir/rl_optimal_control/blob/main/iterative_methods.ipynb)]
- The robot control problem: [[source code](https://github.com/EmYassir/rl_optimal_control/blob/main/iterative_methods.ipynb)]
